                    <p>Blended families take a lot of work. As the father of two young boys and stepfather to three teenage girls, it’s my job to try and keep the peace. Our new family recently moved into a new home together for the first time. It’s been a pretty big adjustment for us all.</p>
                    <p>So, what was the biggest challenge we faced?</p>
                    <p>Turns out it was getting everyone the internet access they wanted.</p>
                    <p>Never underestimate the wrath of kids demanding faster internet!</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section2">
                    <div class="section-title">
                        <h2>Everything Sucks When the Internet is Down</h2>
                    </div>

                    <p> The house we bought was older, but it had plenty of space for everyone. Lots of rooms.</p>
                    <p>As a modern family, each of us has access to a number of devices we use every day, including laptops, tablets, phones, PC’s, gaming stations, etc. And of course, everyone wants to log on at the same time.</p>
                    <p>Despite assurances from my internet supplier that we were getting the best package for our household, there never seemed to be enough bandwidth to keep everyone happy. And some rooms were completely void of any signal at all! No one could agree on a fixed schedule for sharing. Fights ensued. Lots of yelling.</p>
                    <p>No matter the time of day, which room I was in, or what device I was using, half the time, the internet just kept cutting out.</p>

                    <p>The wife and I had to give up watching our favorite TV series at night before bed. Too often the episode we were on would just freeze.</p>
                    <p>It got to the point where I wasn’t sure what I was paying for. It seemed my hard-earned dollars were going towards an unreliable, inconsistent, and limited connection that everybody hated.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section3">
                    <div class="section-title">
                        <h2>Internet Service Providers Don’t Always Help</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>I couldn’t get any straight answers from my ISP. The guys I spoke to were so frustrating to deal with, always putting me on the defensive with their questions.</p>
                    <p>“What do you mean you don’t know what kind of router you have?”</p>
                    <p>“How many gigs of data do you think your wife is going to use next month?”</p>
                    <p>“What kind of gaming do your kids do?”</p>
                    <p>Seriously! Am I supposed to know all this stuff?</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/rangextd-wifi-booster-17.png" alt="rangextd-wifi-booster-17" class="mb-4">
                    <p>Then one night I spoke to a nice fellow I’ll call Buddy.</p>
                    <p>Although Buddy worked for the cable provider, he seemed like a pretty straight shooter. I told him about my woes. Instead of trying to upsell me on another “terrific” package, Buddy suggested I look into something his company didn’t even sell.</p>

                        <h2>An Easy Solution for Problem Wi-Fi Does Exist!</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p><a href="/">RangeXTD</a> is a compact gadget that fits in the palm of your hand. By plugging it into any wall outlet within your home, you can effectively boost the range of your current router. He mentioned it had dual antennas built-in with a speed up to 300 Mbps (I wrote this info down). I have no idea how it works its magic, but Buddy was confident this is what I needed.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/rangextd-wifi-booster-18.png" alt="rangextd-wifi-booster-18" class="mb-4">
                    <p><a href="/">RangeXTD</a> even comes with a LAN port, just in case I ever want to set up a network of wired computers. I think I’ll leave that to my oldest daughter.</p>
                    <p>As per Buddy’s suggestion, I ended up buying two <a href="/">RangeXTDs</a>, one for each floor of my home.</p>
                    <p>Then Buddy asked if I used any of my devices during travel. I told him about my wife being in sales. She never leaves the house without her laptop in tow. He mentioned that <a href="/">RangeXTD</a> also offered a portable USB Wi-Fi Repeater that could help her out.</p>
                    <p>It all sounded good to me.</p>

                        <h2>Superior Wi-Fi with No Service Calls</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>I checked around and ended up ordering the&nbsp;<a href="/">RangeXTD</a> products online. The price I paid was a lot less than some of the options the greedy ISP’s were offering. My package arrived within a few days.</p>
                    <p>I read the instructions that came with the&nbsp;<a href="/">RangeXTD</a> (mercifully, they were concise and to the point). Then I plugged the devices in near the rooms with the worst coverage. I logged onto my laptop in the downstairs guest bedroom, otherwise known as “The Dead Zone.”</p>
                    <p>Setting up&nbsp;<a href="/">RangeXTD</a> with my laptop was super easy, even for a not-so-technical guy like myself. I was so thankful I didn’t have to schedule a service call with my ISP. Those guys never show up when you want them to.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully, everything worked like a charm. I couldn’t get over it. I started streaming a movie right away. I even walked outside onto the deck while it was playing. No interruptions. I couldn’t wait for the kids to come home and try it out. That would be the real test.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/rangextd-wifi-booster-21.png" alt="rangextd-wifi-booster-21" class="mb-4">
                    <p>In a house with five kids, no noise generally means everyone is content. I’m happy to report the house was very quiet the day I installed the&nbsp;<a href="/">RangeXTD</a> units. The next day I confirmed with all the kids, the internet was working top-notch. Everyone was pleased. I was a hero.</p>
                    <p>My wife and I were finally able to finish watching that series we started so long ago. It didn’t freeze on us once!</p>
                    <p>As for the portable USB unit for my wife, she loved it! And it doesn’t just work for her laptop, other devices nearby get the benefit of improved service. Perfect for our family outings! She loves that it offers wireless security encryption when she’s out on the road. I’ll take her word for it.</p>
                    <p>The&nbsp;<a href="/">RangeXTD</a> devices did the trick. Thank you, Buddy!<br><br></p>
                    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE</strong></span>: My Wi-fi is still running perfectly. I recently found a great deal on&nbsp;<a href="/">RangeXTD</a> direct from the supplier. If your signal could use a boost, I’d be tempted to take advantage of this offer before it disappears. The word is out. You don’t have to pay through the roof to get the internet you want.<br><br></p>
